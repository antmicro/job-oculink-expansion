## Overview

This project include PCB design files for an expansion card compatible with Antmicro [Jetson Orin Baseboard](https://github.com/antmicro/jetson-orin-baseboard).
This expansion card exposes a PCIe x2 break-routed from the Nvidia Jetson Orin Nano/NX SoM into an OCuLink-compliant connector.
The PCB design files were prepared in KiCad 9.x
 
## Key features

- Compatible with the [Jetson Orin Baseboard](https://github.com/antmicro/jetson-orin-baseboard)
- Exposes 2 lanes of PCIe via an OCuLink connector
- Provides auxiliary PCIe signals
